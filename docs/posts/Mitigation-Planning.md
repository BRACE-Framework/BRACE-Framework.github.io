# Mitigation Planning

### Summary

**During the needs mapping process, we identified the organization's goals and barriers faced during Internet outages. We can then develop solutions to address these obstacles, considering their risks, impacts, and capacity.**

---
Now that we have figured out the scope of work for the organization and what is hindering it from achieving its operational goals, everything else revolves around mitigating these obstacles or finding alternatives.

## 5 Questions to Guide Your Mitigation Planning
We can ask _**five questions**_ to help identify solutions. We aim to establish a table for each need.

1. **Need**: What do I need?
2. **Options**: What actions/tools could help me achieve this goal?
3. **Impact**: How much does it improve my work?
4. **Cost**: How much will it cost?
5. **Risk**: What are the associated risks?

!!! abstract "Defining the scope"

    It's crucial to determine how "broad" to define the "Necessary Actions." Should it be as general as "deliver news to the audience," or should it specify each workflow step, like "send image to editor" and "editor publishes image"? This decision depends on the severity of the shutdown and your capacity.

    For example, a small city newsroom that can afford satellite Internet has a quick solution by regaining access. In contrast, a resource-limited newsroom, where reporters can't return daily, will require alternative methods for each step, such as protecting footage while filming on the frontline and finding ways to transfer that footage for publication.

We can lay out the thinking process in a **Circumvention Identifying Table**. 

<table class="custom-standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="5">Identify Necessary Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="bg-pink"><b>Need</b><br>What do I need?</td>
      <td class="bg-green"><b>Options</b><br>What actions/tools could help me?</td>
      <td class="bg-blue"><b>Impact</b><br>How much does it improve work?</td>
      <td class="bg-orange"><b>Cost</b><br>How much will it cost?</td>
      <td class="bg-red"><b>Risk</b><br>What are the associated risks?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>

</table>

### STEPS 

## 1. Identify Necessary Actions ("Need")
We need to consider what it takes to achieve the goals identified earlier, as that’s what we truly need.

There can be different solutions for the same goal. When considering their needs, organizations should list as many potentially helpful options as possible. Don't limit yourself to just regaining Internet access. While a technological solution may be the most efficient, it's important to think critically—there may be other ways to achieve your goals. These choices can lead to significantly different solutions, risks, and costs.

For example, for a newsroom aiming to inform the international community about events in their country, one solution could be regaining Internet access, while another could be preserving evidence until Internet access is restored.

<table class="custom-standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="5">Transfer media file (long distance but within country)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="bg-pink">Need<br>What do I need?</td>
      <td class="bg-green">Options<br>What actions/tools could help me?</td>
      <td class="bg-blue">Impact<br>How much does it improve work?</td>
      <td class="bg-orange">Cost<br>What is the cost?</td>
      <td class="bg-red">Risk<br>What are the associated risks?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1. Internet Access</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2. Transfer footage physically</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3. Offline communication</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## 2. Explore Potential Solutions ("Options")
Once we determine what we need, we can explore options to achieve it.

There are different categories of solutions, so we should keep our imagination open to all of them:

- **Software and Apps:** Numerous software programs and mobile applications have been developed for various purposes.

- **Connectivity-Based Solutions:** Hardware based alternative connection. Examples include using alternative SIM cards or roaming services, satellite-based Internet such as Starlink.

- **Advanced Technological Solutions:** Some tools require more involved technical setups beyond basic connectivity, such as configuring local mesh networks or deploying custom hardware solutions.

- **Legacy Technology:** When Internet access is unavailable, reverting to legacy technologies like fax machines and SMS is common.

- **Non-Technological Solutions:** Circumvention doesn’t always need to be technical. For example, storing data on a USB stick and delivering it to someone in a nearby city can be an effective solution.

[Shutdown.Tools](https://shutdown.tools) is another resource that provides a collection of tools, websites, and strategies for human rights defenders, journalists, and others during Internet outages.

## 3. Outline Associated Pros & Cons ("Impact" & "Cost" & "Risks")

Lastly, we need to outline the impact, cost and risks that these circumventions may bring.

#### Impact

The impact of a tool depends on your specific needs. For example, using encrypted SMS to stay in touch with others has a high impact for a newsroom, as it allows them to receive updates and publish stories. However, for an individual human rights advocate whose work focuses mostly on documenting footage rather than constant communication, the impact of that same tool is relatively lower.

#### Cost 

Here, "cost" includes not just money but also manpower, time, etc. Sometimes the cost is too high for a lower-priority need, making it not worth pursuing. Conversely, if the goal is critical, it may be worth pursuing despite a high cost.

#### Risks

##### Navigating Risks During Internet Shutdowns

In countries facing conflict or Internet shutdowns, citizens often deal with relatively bigger risks. There are **physical risks**, like police raids and searches, and **digital risks**, such as surveillance and cyberattacks.

When the Internet goes dark, these dangers often increase. Authorities frequently move more police or military into the streets while ramping up surveillance to keep control.

##### Balancing Tools and Risks

Every tool used to stay connected or share information comes with its own set of risks. When choosing a solution, it is vital to weigh these carefully and ensure everyone involved is fully informed. For example:

* **Physical Transfers:** If you move footage or data using a physical disk or USB drive, you face the risk of it being found during a police search.
* **Device Security:** Carrying sensitive conversations or videos on your phone is dangerous at checkpoints, where security forces may force you to unlock your device.
* **Old Technology:** Using "legacy" tools like SMS or standard phone calls is highly risky because they are not encrypted, meaning the government can easily listen in or read your messages.
* **Legality**: Certain technologies, like VPNs, may be illegal in specific countries. Organizations must be fully informed about these risks.

##### Risk Assessment 

Because every situation is different, it is important to use a risk assessment tool to map out your specific dangers. There are many resources available online from different organizations that can help you plan a safety strategy.

One useful resource is the Security Workbook by Frontline Defenders: [Security Workbook](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/programme/risk-analysis-protection-planning).

!!! abstract

    For example, if using encrypted SMS tools in a highly surveilled country, authorities may notice the cipher texts being sent and draw attention. Physical transfer may be less effective and riskier if there are checkpoints in the area.

Anyhow, we've laid out the possible circumventions.

## 4. Select the Most Suitable Mitigation

Lastly, we need to outline the risks that these circumventions may bring.

There are different tools available to assess these factors. While helpful, they are not compulsory: 

- **Cost Impact Matrix**: Cost-effectiveness can be plotted on a Cost Impact Matrix, which helps identify the most cost-effective circumvention measures. This way, you can evaluate which circumventions are worth pursuing. 

!!! abstract

    For example, a newsroom that is the only bilingual media outlet in the country, with a large following and frequent mentions by Western media, must be able to spread news outside the country.

!!! Be Creative
    Sometimes, we focus too much on technological solutions, but legacy circumventions, such as a USB dead drop, could be more useful. Avoid letting our technical mindset limit our imagination for circumvention. In some cases, gaining Internet access might not be the best solution; preserving media files and transferring them later may be more beneficial.

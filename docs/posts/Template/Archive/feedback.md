## Tool Familiarisation
Collecting and communicating feedback can be useful in two scenarios: (A) identifying usability issues in open-source tools used by the assessed organization, or (B) reporting usability difficulties encountered in open-source tools you yourself used during the assessment.
Conducting a SAFETAG assessment can put you in a unique and valuable position to evaluate the usability and efficacy of tools used by at-risk organizations, as well as tools used during the assessment itself. Many tools are developed without input from high-risk users in global majority countries, leaving them lacking in usability and functionality considerations important to those populations. Your ability to collect feedback offers a unique opportunity to contribute to building feedback loops between tool teams and those users.

The USABLE guidebook is a compilation of activities and resources designed to integrate feedback collection into existing digital security training frameworks, and can equally be used during digital security assessments. The Guidebook provides guidance on collecting feedback from users, engaging developers/tool teams, and how best to document and provide that feedback to provide actionable feedback to developers.

As a SAFETAG auditor you may find themselves in a good position, several USABLE activities are highlighted here, with pointers to the full activity descriptions in the guidebook

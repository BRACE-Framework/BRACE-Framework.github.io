The framework can be broken down into different steps. 
And there is templates / activities to help you fulfill each step. 
(Some templates may be used in multiple steps)

#### 1. Gather relevant information
[Questionnaire](/docs/Template/Questionnaire.md)
[Context Research Guide](/docs/Template/context-Research.md)
#### 2. Identify the specific tasks that must be completed (e.g. publishing three articles online)
[Questionnaire](/docs/Template/Questionnaire.md)
[Needs Mapping](/docs/Template/Needs-Mapping.md)
#### 3. Determine how an internet shutdown would interfere with these tasks, including related risks such as increased police searches
[Needs Mapping](/docs/Template/Needs-Mapping.md)
#### 4. Propose possible workarounds
[Needs Mapping](/docs/Template/Needs-Mapping.md)
[Shutdown Navigator Project](https://github.com/shutdowncircumvention/shutdowncircumvention.github.io)
#### 5. Assess the feasibility of each proposed workaround, considering:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Risks associated with implementing each workaround
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. organization’s capacity to carry out the proposed solutions

[Needs Mapping](/docs/Template/Needs-Mapping.md)
[Questionnaire](/docs/Template/Questionnaire.md)
[Context Research Guide](/docs/Template/context-Research.md)
#### 6. Find countermeasures or circumvention strategies for each suggestion, if available; if not, suggest alternative options

#### 7. Draft a mitigation workflow to be followed during an internet shutdown
[Mitigation Planning](/docs/Template/Mitigation-Planning.md)
#### 8. Use a shutdown simulator to test the proposed workflow
TBC
#### 9. Refine the workflow based on the simulation results, if needed
[Mitigation Planning](/docs/Template/Mitigation-Planning.md)
#### 10. Identify any tools or systems that must be installed, configured, or prepared in advance
[Mitigation Work Plan](/docs/Template/Mitigation-workplan.md)
#### 11. Finalize the work plan and assign responsibilities
[Mitigation Work Plan](/docs/Template/Mitigation-workplan.md)
#### 12. Carry out tool installation, configuration, and familiarization
[Tool Familiarisation](/docs/Template/familiarisation.md)
#### 13. Security training
[Security Training Resources](/docs/Template/security-training.md)
#### 14. Adopt and adjust during the shutdown
#### 15. Collect feedback during and after shutdown if possible
[Feedback Collection](/docs/Template/security-training.md)

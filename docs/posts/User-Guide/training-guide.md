# BRACE Facilitator Guide (WORKING DOCUMENT)
BRACE takes a practical, context-specific approach, grounded in the daily realities, risks, capacities, and constraints that civic groups face. Rather than prescribing tools or ideal models, it focuses on helping groups decide in advance:

* what must continue,  
* who decides,  
* and how work can continue when connectivity fails.

The framework is designed to be used independently.

**What is BRACE Level 1 (Basic)?**  
BRACE Level 1 is the basic entry level of the framework.

It is designed for groups that:

* have limited time and capacity,  
* may not have technical expertise,  
* need something simple that works under pressure.

Level 1 focuses on **continuity and basic preparedness**, not optimisation or best practice.  
The goal is not to plan for every possible risk, but to make sure essential work does not fall apart when a likely Internet disruption occurs.

At Level 1, a successful outcome means that a group can:

* identify one likely disruption scenario,  
* choose one priority that must continue,  
* agree on a simple fallback plan,  
* clarify who decides and who acts,  
* and capture this in a short, usable action plan.

Completing Level 1 and stopping there is a valid and successful outcome.

## **What Level 1 deliberately does not do**

BRACE Level 1 is not:

* a digital security or circumvention training,  
* a comprehensive risk management framework,  
* a tool demonstration session,  
* a worst-case planning exercise,  
* or a long or repeated training.

More advanced planning, technical measures, and multiple scenarios belong in later levels of BRACE.

# **Purpose of the Level 1 Training**

This training helps participants complete BRACE Level 1 by guiding them through a small set of simple tools that turn their lived experience into a basic contingency plan.  
The emphasis is on:

* realism rather than completeness,  
* simplicity rather than sophistication,  
* decisions rather than documentation.

The output is one plan, not a full strategy.

# **Recommended Training Format**

* Duration: 60-90 minutes  
* Group size: 3 to 10 participants  
* Materials: Printed tools or a shared document, pens  
* Training can be delivered in person, online, or in a self-led, asynchronous format.

# **Trainer Role and Approach**

The trainer or facilitator’s role is to:

* keep the group focused on one scenario and one priority,  
* prevent overplanning and scope creep,  
* help participants stay within what is realistic for them.  
* Do not push for “best practice.”  
* Focus on what would actually happen in your/their context.  
* If participants struggle to choose, help them narrow the scope.

# **Training Flow (Level 1\)**

## **Grounding the session**

Set expectations at the start:

* Internet disruptions are uneven and unpredictable.  
* Planning reduces confusion, not risk.  
* Simple plans are more likely to be used.

**Key rule**:  We are not planning for everything. We are planning for one thing we can handle.

**Tool 1 Questionnaire**  
Participants complete the questionnaire individually or in pairs.  
Purpose:

* surface the reality of how the group works,  
* identify constraints,  
* document what already happens during disruptions.

Do not debate answers. There are no right or wrong responses.

**Tool 2  Readiness and scenario selection**  
Participants assess their readiness and select:

* one likely disruption scenario (not the worst case),  
* one priority that would cause the most harm if it failed.  
* If everything feels important, force a choice.

This step sets the direction for the rest of the session.

## **Tool 3 Contingency mapping**

Participants map:

* what will break first,  
* what must continue at a minimum,  
* one fallback option,  
* one last-resort option,  
* who initiates decisions and who takes over,  
* basic safety considerations.

Guidance for the trainer:

* If a plan takes more than five minutes to explain, simplify it.  
* If it depends on new tools or training, simplify it.  
* If it increases risk, reduce the scope or stop.

External tools should only be discussed if they are genuinely needed.

## **Tool 4 Action plan**

Participants turn their decisions into a single, simple action plan.  
Emphasise:

* this is not a policy document,  
* it should be easy to remember under stress,  
* one page is enough.

Agree on:

* who activates the plan, who takes over if they are unreachable,  
* how the team knows the plan is active,  
* when the plan will be reviewed.

## **When to Stop**

End the training once:

* one scenario has been planned,  
* one priority has been covered,  
* one action plan exists.

Do not add extra scenarios “just in case.”  
Stopping at this point means the training has done its job.

Core message to reinforce → A simple plan that people actually use is better than a perfect plan that no one remembers.

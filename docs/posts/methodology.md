# Framework Methodology

The BRACE framework is broken down into four stages: it is basically a **threat modeling → needs/workflow mapping → mitigation/design pipeline, with a final layer on action planning**.

This framework emphasizes methodology rather than specific tools. The focus is on how tech and security personnel can determine the most suitable circumvention strategies for their trainees or organization. There is no one "perfect" tool; instead, the goal is to find "the perfect tool" that best meets your needs.

Essentially, this methodology serves as a reference for thinking about Internet outages. While the BRACE framework offers a useful structure, skilled facilitators can adapt the process as long as trainees remain well-informed and engaged in discussions.

## Navigating this Framework
The BRACE framework includes four steps, each with guidelines and templates. 

While the BRACE framework provides a helpful structure, skilled facilitators can adapt the process as long as the trainees are well-informed and engaged in discussions.

The activities can be adjusted or customized to suit specific situations.

## Needs Mapping

---

**Summary**
To develop a mitigation plan, an organization must first identify its operational goals. This initial step aims to guide organizations through identifying their needs, so that we can break them down, prioritize them, and explore alternative means of achieving specific goals.

Sometimes, organizations become so accustomed to daily operations that it feels like muscle memory, making it difficult to articulate and logically break down their goals. However, this articulation and analysis are crucial for effective contingency planning.

---

**1. Identify Organization Goals**
These questions can help organizations to clearly describe the organization mission and goals:

* What does your organization exist to do?
* Who do you serve, and why?
* What activities must continue to reach your goal?
* To finish the activities, what steps are involved?

!!! Note Note for Trainers

Help them distill their answers into a **clear and rigid purpose statement**. This could sound like:

* "Deliver news to our community"
* "Coordinate public campaigns and events."
* "Provide legal aid to marginalized groups."
* "Publish human rights violations edvidence."

But not:

* "Report news."
* "Support democratic movement."

**Ideally, you will be able to fill this table like this: **

Once we figure out **primary goal** — everything else is built around supporting it.

**2. Mapping Challenge or Constraints**
Now, list the challenge or constraints the organization might face that will stop them from achieving specific goals when Internet shutdown happens:

- Does it require internet to do so? And on what device?
- Would there be human factor that stops you from doing so?
- Would there be risk? List all digital and non digital risk.

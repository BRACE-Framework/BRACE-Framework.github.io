    This part of the process primarily involves gathering insights from interviews with the organization, supplemented by some pre-interview desk research.


By the end of the regional context research, we aim to have a deep understanding of the following aspects, but not limited to:

- **Work Nature**: Understand the type of work the organization engages in, whether it’s reporting, advocacy, peer support, or others. This includes their mission, goals, and corresponding workflows.
- **Staff**: Determine the number of people involved, their departmental structure, and the roles and responsibilities of each individual.
- **Policy**: Review current organizational policies, if any, including both technical and non-technical protocols.
- **Capacity**: Assess how the organization operates, how busy they are, and their budget for purchasing or subscriptions.
- **Risk Level**: Evaluate whether they are a well-known or high-profile organization.
- **Staff/Organization Social Background**: Consider factors such as ethnicity, which can influence how heavily they are targeted.
- **Technical Background**: Examine their digital wellness, whether they have a security policy, and how tech-savvy the staff are.

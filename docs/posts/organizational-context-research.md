# Organizational Context Research

**Summary**

**While facilitators have a better understanding of technology and internet infrastructure, users know their situations best. Therefore, the step of organizational context research is crucial for understanding the background information, needs, risks, and capacities of the organization or individual you work with.**

---

Even within the same city, an organization's characteristics can significantly influence its risks and needs, resulting in vastly different effective circumvention strategies.

This part of the process primarily involves gathering insights from interviews with the organization, supplemented by interview desk research.

By the end of the regional context research, we aim to have a deep understanding of the following aspects, but not limited to:

- **Work Nature**: Understand the type of work the organization engages in, whether it’s reporting, advocacy, peer support, or others. This includes their mission, goals, and corresponding workflows.
- **Staff**: Determine the number of people involved, their departmental structure, and the roles and responsibilities of each individual.
- **Policy**: Review current organizational policies, if any, including both technical and non-technical protocols.
- **Capacity**: Assess how the organization operates, how busy they are, and their budget for purchasing or subscriptions.
- **Risk Level**: Evaluate whether they are a well-known or high-profile organization.
- **Staff/Organization Social Background**: Consider factors such as ethnicity, which can influence how heavily they are targeted.
- **Technical Background**: Examine their digital wellness, whether they have a security policy, and how tech-savvy the staff are.

## Organizational Context Research
Even within the same city, the nature of an organization can significantly affect its risks and needs, leading to vastly different effective circumvention strategies.

    This part of the process primarily involves gathering insights from interviews with the organization, supplemented by some pre-interview desk research.

By the end of the regional context research, we aim to have a deep understanding of the following aspects, but not limited to:

- **Work Nature**: Understand the type of work the organization engages in, whether it’s reporting, advocacy, peer support, or others. This includes their mission, goals, and corresponding workflows.
- **Staff**: Determine the number of people involved, their departmental structure, and the roles and responsibilities of each individual.
- **Policy**: Review current organizational policies, if any, including both technical and non-technical protocols.
- **Capacity**: Assess how the organization operates, how busy they are, and their budget for purchasing or subscriptions.
- **Risk Level**: Evaluate whether they are a well-known or high-profile organization.
- **Staff/Organization Social Background**: Consider factors such as ethnicity, which can influence how heavily they are targeted.
- **Technical Background**: Examine their digital wellness, whether they have a security policy, and how tech-savvy the staff are.

## Regional Context Research
Context is the heart of effective mitigation planning. It shapes the circumventions you choose, the legality of the tools you use, how well a workaround functions, and how easily people can adapt to new technology.

Even if you’re from the country or familiar with its background, it’s important to remember that different communities, regions, and ethnic groups can have very different contexts.

    This part of the process involves gathering and analyzing desk research by the trainer, along with insights from interviews.

By the end of the regional context research, we aim to have a deep understanding of the following aspects, but not limited to:

- **Type of Shutdown**: Identify the nature and patterns of shutdowns that have occurred in the country or region. Predicting these patterns may help anticipate future occurrences.
- **Common Repression Tactics and Threats**: Identify the most common tactics of repression and threats, both digital and physical. Don’t overlook non-political examples, such as an increase in theft during blackouts.
- **Geographical Factors**: Consider the geographical context, such as proximity to borders and the influence of military groups in the area.
- **Internet Speed and Usage Habits**: Assess the internet penetration rate and the level of technological proficiency among the population, as the time and effort required for organizations to adapt to new technology or tools can vary greatly.
- **Rural vs. Urban Dynamics**: Examine the differences in population distribution and access between rural and urban areas. For example, mesh networks tend to work better in densely populated areas.
- **Legal Considerations**: Determine whether certain tools, such as VPNs, are illegal in the region.

!!! warning

    * Use VPNs or Tor to search if conducting the search from a country that is highly competitive with the organization's country, or is known to surveil.
    * Maintain data about any targeted attacks and attacks affecting the organization's line of work secure.

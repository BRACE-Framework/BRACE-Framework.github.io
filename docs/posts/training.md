## Security Training 

**Summary**

**Often during an Internet shutdown, security risk also increase as the cause is often special events, such as election, uprising or war. The authorities often increase the police force in opublic, leasing to bigger physical security risk, or increase digitl repression such as survielnce or cyber attacker. Therefore, both physical and digital safety is more important during the time of Internet disrption. therefore, Prioritize training on  digital security practices, or even securiry accessment is esstneial. **

## Prioritizing Training (from Miaan Group's Shutdown Protocol (V2))

Prioritizing training for preparing and responding to internet shutdowns involves focusing on the most critical skills and knowledge that will have the greatest impact on community resilience and security. Here’s a suggested approach for prioritizing training:

1. **Identify Key Vulnerabilities**  
- **Assess Current Knowledge**: Begin by assessing the current level of digital security awareness and technical skills within the community or organization. Identify gaps in knowledge that are most likely to lead to vulnerabilities during a shutdown.

- **Understand Specific Threats**: Tailor training to address the specific threats each group faces, such as government surveillance, device confiscation, or the inability to communicate securely during a shutdown.

2. **Focus on Essential Skills First**  
- **Basic Digital Security**: Prioritize training on basic digital security practices, such as setting strong passwords, using two-factor authentication, and recognizing phishing attacks. These foundational skills are essential for all users.

- **Secure Communication Tools**:\* Provide immediate training on the use of secure communication tools that can function during shutdowns, such as encrypted messaging apps, mesh networks, and satellite communication systems.

3. **Tailor Training to Specific Needs**  
- **Ethnic Minorities**: Focus on training that enhances their ability to communicate securely during complete or partial shutdowns. This includes using alternative communication methods like satellite phones or mesh networks and understanding how to avoid surveillance.

- **Investigative Journalists**: Prioritize advanced digital security training, such as encryption, secure data storage, and safe reporting practices. Journalists are often at the highest risk and require more sophisticated skills to protect their work and sources.

- **Religious Minorities**: Emphasize training on secure communication practices that can protect their community during periods of heightened persecution. Ensure they are familiar with tools that can maintain internal communication even when targeted.

4. **Implement Practical Training Sessions**  
- **Hands-On Workshops**: Conduct practical, hands-on workshops where participants can practice using the tools and methods they’ve learned. This ensures they are not just theoretically prepared but also practically capable.

- **Scenario-Based Drills**: Run scenario-based drills that simulate an internet shutdown. This helps participants practice their response in real-time and highlights any areas where additional training may be needed.

5. **Develop Continuous Learning Resources**  
- **Access to Ongoing Support**: Provide access to continuous learning resources, such as online tutorials, guides, and forums where individuals can ask questions and share experiences.

- **Localized Training Materials**: Ensure training materials are available in local languages and are accessible to all members of the community. Use resources like [Iran After Dark](https://filter.watch/irandarkhamooshi/)[^5] to supplement training with region-specific information.

6. **Evaluate and Adapt Training Programs**  
- **Feedback Loops**: Regularly gather feedback from participants to assess the effectiveness of the training. Use this feedback to make necessary adjustments to the content or delivery of future training sessions.

- **Update Training Regularly**: As new threats emerge or new tools become available, update the training programs to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

7. **Build Trust and Engagement**  
- **Community-Led Initiatives**: Encourage peer-led training sessions and community-based learning. When training is delivered by trusted community members, it’s more likely to be accepted and adopted.  
    
- **Engagement Activities**: Use community events, discussions, and workshops to keep the community engaged and invested in continuous learning and preparation.

By following these steps, you can ensure that training is prioritized effectively, focusing on the most critical needs first and building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will help the community or organization remain resilient during and after an internet shutdown.

## Basic Digital Security Training

Basic Digital Security: such as setting strong passwords, using two-factor authentication, and recognizing phishing attacks. These foundational skills are essential for all users.

There are many resources developed by various organizations across different regions, so this framework will not go into detail. 

However, remember to take a bottom-up approach and tailor the security training to fit the organization's unique needs and threat model.

**SAFETAG**
SAFETAG is a professional audit framework that adapts traditional penetration testing and risk assessment methodologies to be relevant to smaller non-profit organizations based or operating in the developing world.

**Security in a Box**
Security in-a-box is a collaborative effort of the Tactical Technology Collective and Front Line. It was created to meet the digital security and privacy needs of advocates and human rights defenders. Security in-a-box includes a How-to Booklet, which addresses a number of important digital security issues. It also provides a collection of Hands-on Guides, each of which includes a particular freeware or open source software tool, as well as instructions on how you can use that tool to secure your computer, protect your information or maintain the privacy of your Internet communication.

**Frontline Defenders**
Front Line Defenders's Workbook on security: Practical steps for human rights defenders at risk is designed to raise awareness about security issues and to help human rights defenders consider how to mitigate threats. The workbook takes human rights defenders through the steps to producing a security plan – for individuals and for organisations. It follows a systematic approach for assessing their security situation and developing risk and vulnerability reduction strategies and tactics.

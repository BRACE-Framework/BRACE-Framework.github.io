Use resources like Iran After Dark to supplement training with region-specific information.</p> <p>Evaluate and Adapt Training Programs  - Feedback Loops: Regularly gather feedback from participants to assess the effectiveness of the training. Use this feedback to make necessary adjustments to the content or delivery of future training sessions.</p> <p>Update Training Regularly:   - As new threats emerge or new tools become available, update the training programs to ensure they remain relevant and effective.</p> <p>Build Trust and Engagement  - Community-Led Initiatives: Encourage peer-led training sessions and community-based learning.
